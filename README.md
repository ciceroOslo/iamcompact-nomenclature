# iamcompact-nomenclature
Data structure definition for validation of model outputs in the HORIZON EUROPE
project IAM COMPACT, using nomenclature-iamc

## Installation
This package can either be installed as a Python package, or the
`iamcompact-nomenclature/definitions` folder can be downloaded and used directly
with the `nomenclature-iamc` package.

To install as a Python package using `pip`:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/ciceroOslo/iamcompact-nomenclature.git
```
Or to install a specific branch or version (`branchname` in the command below):
```
pip install git+https://github.com/ciceroOslo/iamcompact-nomenclature.git@branchname
```

If you use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/), you can use the following commands (when in your project directory):
```
poetry add git+https://github.com/ciceroOslo/iamcompact-nomenclature.git
```
or
```
poetry add git+https://github.com/ciceroOslo/iamcompact-nomenclature.git#branchname
```

Eventually, the package will probably be published on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) so that you can install it directly with a command like `pip install iamcompact-nomenclature`. At the moment, this has not been done, hence the need for using the more complex commands above to install from the repository.

At the moment, there are no plans to create a
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) package. If you have a pressing need
for that, please [create an
issue](https://github.com/ciceroOslo/iamcompact-nomenclature/issues). If you are
part of the IAM COMPACT project and prefer to contact the package maintainers
directly, please see for contact info.
