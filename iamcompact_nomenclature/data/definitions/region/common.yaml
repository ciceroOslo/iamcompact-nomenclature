# The R10 definitions were introduced by the LIMITS project
# funded by the EU's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013
# (grant agreement no. 282846)
# updated to be consistent with IPCC AR6 WGIII Annex II R10 regions
# https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Annex-II.pdf
#
# NB! Commented out in IAM COMPACT. The R10 regions are not unambiguously
# defined in the AR6 WG3 model registration template, and the definition in
# the original LIMITS source does not appear to quite agree with the definitions
# used here (despite being ambiguous in the first place). There appears to be
# considerable variation in how different models define the mapping of their
# regions to R10, so we need to the R10 regions out to avoid issues when
# vetting the harmonized variables that the models use.
