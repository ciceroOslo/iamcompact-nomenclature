# This list of fuels will replace any occurrence of `{Industry sectors}`
# in a variable-definition yaml file.
# Some subindustries here were added in IAM COMPACT (present in IPCC AR6, but
# not in openENTRANCE). In addition several of the description tags were
# expanded with IPCC category codes (as in the AR6 documentation in IIASA's
# online scenario exporer), and some spellings were changed to conform to AR6.
# The names used in the openENTRANCE original don't appear to actually have been
# used in result files in the openENTRANCE scenario database.
