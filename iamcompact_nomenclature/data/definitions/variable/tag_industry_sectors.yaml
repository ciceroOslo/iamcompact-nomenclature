# This list of fuels will replace any occurrence of `{Industry sectors}`
# in a variable-definition yaml file.
# Some subindustries here were added in IAM COMPACT (present in IPCC AR6, but
# not in openENTRANCE). In addition several of the description tags were
# expanded with IPCC category codes (as in the AR6 documentation in IIASA's
# online scenario exporer), and some spellings were changed to conform to AR6.
# The names used in the openENTRANCE original don't appear to actually have been
# used in result files in the openENTRANCE scenario database.

  # Decapitalized the "f" in `Non-ferrous Metals` (spelled `Non-Ferrous Metals`
  # in the openENTRANCE original) in IAM COMPACT, to conform with IPCC AR6.
  - Non-ferrous Metals:
      description: non-ferrous metals industry sector (IPCC category 1A2)

  # Decapitalized the "m" in "metallic" in IAM COMPACT. Also commenting out the
  # whole sector, since it presumably would overlap with `Cement`, and does not
  # appear to be used in any of the IAM COMPACT models. Better to add it back
  # if needed, and flag the need to ensure non-overlap with Cement or to be
  # more specific.
