# This list is intended as short-hand for variables that should be reported
# for residential and commercial combined as well as separate

# Several things in this tag list were added and modified in IAM COMPACT, to
# conform more closely to IPCC AR6, and to resolve the seemingly overlapping
# scopes.

- Residential/Commercial:
  - Residential and Commercial:
      description: residential, commercial, institutional sectors (IPCC category
          1A4a and 1A4b)
  # "Residential" and "Commercial" were modified in IAM COMPACT to specify that
  # they should only be used when only one of them is represented. Commenting
  # out for now, to make sure the issue gets flagged for models that make use of
  # these variables.
#   - Residential:
#       description: residential sector. Should only be used if the model
#           represents only residential and not commercial buildings. If both are
#           represented, instead use `Residential and Commercial|Residential`
#   - Commercial:
#       description: commercial sector. Should only be used if the model
#           represents only residential and not commercial buildings. If both are
#           represented, instead use `Residential and Commercial|Commercial`
