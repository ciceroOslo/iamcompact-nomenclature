# This list of inputs will replace any occurrence of `{Residential/Commercial}`
# in a variable-definition yaml file

# This list is intended as short-hand for variables that should be reported
# for residential and commercial combined as well as separate

# Several things in this tag list were added and modified in IAM COMPACT, to
# conform more closely to IPCC AR6, and to resolve the seemingly overlapping
# scopes.
