# Added in IAM COMPACT. Contains variables for consumption of industrial
# products. Currently only Steel, through the variable `Consumption|Steel` used
# by GCAM. This variable is present in neither AR6, nor in openENTRANCE or in
# the common-definitions repository. It is also unusual in that other variables
# named `Consumption|*` in other contexts usually refer to consumption in the
# economic sense, and are denoted in value terms (monetary units). But it's not
# clear what else to call industrial consumption, unless it could instead be
# categorized under `Demand|*`.

- Consumption|Steel:
    description: Consumption of steel. Note that unlike many other variables
        under `Consumption|*`, this variable denotes consumption measured included
        physical terms, not monetary value.
    unit: Mt/yr
