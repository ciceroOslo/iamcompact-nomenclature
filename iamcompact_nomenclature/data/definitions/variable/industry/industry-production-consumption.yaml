# Added in IAM COMPACT. Contains variables for production and consumption of
# industrial products. Currently only Steel, through the variable
# `Consumption|Steel` used by GCAM. This variable is present in neither AR6, nor
# in openENTRANCE or in the common-definitions repository. It is also unusual in
# that other variables named `Consumption|*` in other contexts usually refer to
# consumption in the economic sense, and are denoted in value terms (monetary
# units). But it's not clear what else to call industrial consumption, unless it
# could instead be categorized under `Demand|*`.
