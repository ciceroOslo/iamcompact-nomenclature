    ----------
    failed_checks : pd.DataFrame|None
        A dataframe with the items that failed the checks. The columns are:
          * "variable": The value of the aggregated variable
          * "components": The sum of the components.
        The index is equal to the index for each datapoint of the aggregated
        variable that failed the check. This DataFrame is the same as that
        returned by `DataStructureDefinition.check_aggregate` and
        `IamDataFrame.check_aggregate`. Only variables for which the attribute
        `check-aggregate` is set in `dsd` will be checked, and only the
        components listed in the `components` attribute of each variable for
        which it exists (see the `nomenclature-iamc` documentation,
        https://nomenclature-iamc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/variable.html).
        If all checks pass, this will be `None`.
    aggregation_map : dict[str, list[str]
        A dictionary of the component variables that were summed and compared to
        each aggregate variable. The keys are the aggregated variables, and the
        values are lists of the component variables that were included in the
        sum.
    not_checked : list[str]
        A list of the variables that were not checked. This will usually be
        equal to the variables that exist in both in the `iamdf` and `dsd`
        argument passed to `check_var_aggregates`, but for which the attribute
        `check-aggregate` is False or not set in `dsd`.
    unknown : list[str]
        A list of the variables in the `iamdf` argument to
        `check_var_aggregates` that are not present in the `dsd` argument. If
        `iamdf` has been through proper validation of variable names, this list
        should be empty.
    dsd : nomenclature.DataStructureDefinition
        The `DataStructureDefinition` object that was used for the check.
    rtol, atol : float, optional
        Relative and absolute tolerances that were specified for the check
        (usually passed to `numpy.isclose`). Will be `None` if no tolerance
        arguments were passed to `check_var_aggregates`, in which the case the
        default tolerances for either `numpy.isclose` itself or for
        `nomenclature.DataStructureDefinition.check_aggregate` or
        `nomenclature.IamdDataFrame.check_aggregate` will have been used.

    regions defined in the `RegionProcessor` object passed to that function.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    failed_checks : pd.DataFrame|None
        A dataframe with the items that failed the checks. The columns are:
          * "original": The value for the original aggregated native region
          * "aggregated": The sum of the constituent regions
          * "difference (%)" : The percentage difference between the original

        The index is equal to the index for each datapoint of the aggregated
        region that failed the check. This DataFrame is the same as that
        returned by `nomenclature.RegionProcessor.check_region_aggregation`. If
        all checks pass, this will be `None`.
    aggregation_map : dict[str, dict[str, list[str]]
        The region mapping in `processor` that was used for the check. The keys
        of the outer dict are the model names. The keys of the inner dict are
        the aggregated common regions, and the values are lists of the native
        constituent regions of the model for that common region.
    common_aggregated_regions : dict[str, list[str]]
        Dictionary of common, aggregated regions that were actually present in
        each model in the `iamdf` argument to `check_region_aggregates`. The
        keys are model names, and the values are lists with common aggregated
        region names (from `processor`) that were present in the model data. If
        the list for a given model is empty, it means that no aggregated
        variable values were actually checked for that model, since no common
        aggregated region names were found in the data for that model.
    regions_not_processed : dict[str, list[str]]
        Dict of lists of the native regions that were not processed for each
        model. This will usually be equal to the regions that exist in both in
        the `iamdf` and `dsd` argument passed to `check_region_aggregates`, but
        which were not present as either an aggregated common region or a native
        constituent region in `processor.mappings` for each model. It does *not*
        contain regions that are present in `unknown_regions` for a given model.
    vars_not_checked : list[str]
        A list of variables that were not checked in the region sums. This will
        usually be equal to variables present in both the `iamdf` and `dsd`
        arguments to `check_region_aggregates` for which the attribute
        `skip-region-aggregation` is set to `true` in `dsd`.
    unknown_models : list[str]

        A dict of lists of the regions for each model in the `iamdf` argument to
        `check_region_aggregates` that are not present in the `dsd` or in the
        `processor` argument. The keys of the dict are the model names. If
        `iamdf` has been through proper validation of region names, this list
        should be empty.
    unknown_vars : list[str]
        A list of the variables in the `iamdf` argument to
        `check_region_aggregates` that are not present in the `dsd` argument. If
        `iamdf` has been through proper validation of region names, this list

    processor : nomenclature.RegionProcessor
        The `RegionProcessor` object that was used for the check.
    rtol : float, optional
        Relative tolerance that was specified for the check (usually passed to
        `numpy.isclose`). Will be `None` if no tolerance argument was passed to
        `check_region_aggregates`, in which the case the default set in

    """Check aggregated variables based on aggregate specs in a DSD.
    
    The function mainly performs the same task as
    `nomenclature.DataStructureDefinition.check_aggregate`: It checks whether
    aggregated variables with the attribute `check-aggregate` set to True in the
    DSD are equal to the sum (or other aggregation method) of their component
    variables. If the attribute `components` is set for an aggregated variable,
    only the component variables listed in the `components` attribute will be
    included in the sum, or the aggregate will be checked against multiple
    hierarchies of components if they are present in the `components` attribute.

    The function additionally provides information on which aggregate variables
    have been checked against which components, which variables were not
    checked, and which variables are not present in the data structure
    definition. This information is returned in a `VarAggregationCheckResult`
    object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    iamdf : pyam.IamDataFrame
        The `IamDataFrame` to check.
    dsd : nomenclature.DataStructureDefinition
        The `DataStructureDefinition` to use for the check. This object should
        have been created with the `nomenclature` package, and should have been
        set up with the `check-aggregate` attribute for the variables that are
        to be checked, and optionally the `components` attribute for aggregate
        variables for which not all components should be included, or for which
        there are separate hierarchies of components (such as "Final Energy"
        being disaggregated both by sector and by energy carrier). If the
        function is called from the top-level as
        `iamcompact_nomenclature.check_var_aggregates`, `dsd` is an optional
        keyword argument, and will be set equal to the return value of
        `iamcompact_nomenclature.get_dsd()` by default. If it is called as
        `iamcompact_nomenclature.aggregation.check_var_aggregates`, `dsd` is a
        required argument.
    rtol : float, optional
        Relative tolerance for the check. Passed to `numpy.isclose`, see the
        documentation of that function for details. At the time of writing, the
        default value is `1e-5`. Note that the relative and absolute tolerances
        are added together to produce the actual tolerance threshold.
    atol : float, optional
        Absolute tolerance for the check. Passed to `numpy.isclose`, see the
        documentation of that function for details. At the time of writing, the
        default value is `1e-8`. Note that the relative and absolute tolerances
        are added together to produce the actual tolerance threshold.

    The function will check whether aggregated variables are sums of their
    component variables, or optionally just whether the component variables sum
    up to less than the aggregated variable. 

    If any of the component variables add up to something other than or greter
    than (depending on `require_complete`) the aggregated variable, the function
    will return a tuple of a `pandas.DataFrame` with the items that failed the
    check along with the aggregate variable value and the component sum, and a
    dictionary of the component variables that were summed and compared to the
    aggregate variable. If all checks pass, the first component of the returned
    tuple will be `None`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    iamdf : pyam.IamDataFrame
        The `IamDataFrame` to check or process.
    variables : sequence of str, optional
        The aggregated variables to check. If not provided, the function will
        check all top-level variables (i.e., variables that don't have a parent
        variable), and all aggregated variables down to the level specified by
        `num_sublevels`. "Top-level" variables here may include variables that
        are components of other variables, but where there is no direct parent
        variable, e.g., because there is a gap of more than one level between
        the variable and the closest variable above it in the hierarchyl.
        Defaults to `None`.
    num_sublevels : int, optional
        How deep to recurse to aggregated subvariables. Set to 0 to check only
        the variables in `variables` against the sum of components one level
        below, and not check any of the components that are aggregates of deeper
        sublevels. Set to `None` to check all sublevels. Defaults to `None`.
    require_complete : bool, optional
        Whether to require that the components sum up to the aggregated
        variable, or just that they not sum up to anything *greater than* the
        aggregated variable. Set to False if you don't want to require that the
        data have a complete set of components for each aggregated variable, but
        do want to check that the aggregate is not smaller than the sum of the
        included components. Defaults to `True` (i.e., require that the
        components sum up to the aggregated variable).
    variable_dimname : str, optional
        The name of the variable dimension in the `IamDataFrame`. Defaults to
        "variable".
    method : str, optional
        The method to use for finding the component variables (passed to
        `pyam.IamDataFrame.check_aggregate`). Defaults to "sum".
    rtol : float, optional
        Relative tolerance for the check. Passed to `numpy.isclose`, see the
        documentation of that function for details. At the time of writing, the
        default value is `1e-5`. Note that the relative and absolute tolerances
        are added together to produce the actual tolerance threshold.
    atol : float, optional
        Absolute tolerance for the check. Passed to `numpy.isclose`, see the
        documentation of that function for details. At the time of writing, the
        default value is `1e-8`. Note that the relative and absolute tolerances
        are added together to produce the actual tolerance threshold.

    Returns
    -------
    (failed_checks, aggregation_map) failed_checks : pandas.DataFrame or None
        A dataframe with the items that failed the checks. The columns are: -
        "variable": The value of the aggregated variable - "components": The sum
        of the components The index is equal to the index for each datapoint of

    variables to skip.

    The function additionally provides information on which aggregate regions
    have been checked against which components, which regions were not checked,
    and which regions are not present in the data structure definition, as well
    as what variables were not aggregated and checked. This information is
    returned in a `RegionAggregationCheckResult` object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    iamdf : pyam.IamDataFrame
        The `IamDataFrame` to check.
    dsd : nomenclature.DataStructureDefinition
        The `DataStructureDefinition` to use for the check. This object should
        have been created with the `nomenclature` package. If the function is
        called from the top-level as
        `iamcompact_nomenclature.check_region_aggregates`, `dsd` is an optional
        keyword argument, and will be set equal to the return value of
        `iamcompact_nomenclature.get_dsd()` by default. If it is called as
        `iamcompact_nomenclature.aggregation.check_region_aggregates`, `dsd` is
        a required argument.
    processor : nomenclature.RegionProcessor
        The `RegionProcessor` to use for the check. This object should have been
        created with the `nomenclature` package. If the function is called from
        the top-level as `iamcompact_nomenclature.check_region_aggregates`,
        `processor` is an optional keyword argument, and will be set equal to
        the return value of `iamcompact_nomenclature.get_region_processor()` by
        default. If it is called as
        `iamcompact_nomenclature.aggregation.check_region_aggregates`,
        `processor` is a required argument.
    rtol_difference : float, optional
        Relative tolerance for the check of the difference between the original
        and the aggregate of the constituent regions. Passed to
        `nomenclature.RegionProcessor.check_region_aggregation`. Optional,
        defaults to `None`. If `None`, the default relative tolerance for
        `nomenclature.RegionProcessor.check_region_aggregation` will be used
        (0.01, i.e., 1% at the time of writing).

    Returns
    -------
    RegionAggregationCheckResult
        Results of the check. See the docstring for `RegionAggregationCheckResult`
        for definition of the attributes.
